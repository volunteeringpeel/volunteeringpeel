Je m’appelle Leigh-Ann and I’m super excited to start my third year with Volunteering Peel as this year’s Chairperson and one of the Heads of Events Requests.  It makes me so happy to see volunteers coming together from all over Peel. They say in life, it’s the little things that really count, and to me, volunteering makes up a lot of those little moments. From getting lost to running around, I would never give up my volunteering experiences for anything. They have given me so many great memories, experiences and life lessons. When I’m not volunteering, I love reading, attempting to memorize musical lyrics, and repping TEAM CAP. If you ever see me around at events or just in general, let’s have a conversation!"),

I’m Mahima Siali, a grade 11 student at Mississauga Secondary School, and I’m thrilled to be a part of Volunteering Peel this year as Vice-Chair and Head of Human Resources. I love volunteering because, honestly, next to no events could ever happen without a dedicated group of individuals putting in time to help them run smoothly, and it’s always an honour to be part of one of those groups. It’s also a great chance to meet new people and is really the only way you can get me to wake up early on a weekend. Aside from volunteering, I sometimes also read or hang out with friends. Tired of hearing me drone on about myself? Come to an event and tell me all about yourself instead!"),

I am psyched to start off my second year as one of the Heads of Events Request! Being a part of Volunteering Peel has allowed me to participate in many different experiences, meeting many new people in the process. When I’m not preoccupied with life, I enjoy watching anime, and procrastinating or almost not doing my homework. If you ever see me at one of our events, don’t be afraid to say hello!"),

I am super excited to be a part of Volunteering Peel for my second year! I am a passionate individual, and volunteering is one the many things I love to do. Through my experiences I have been able to meet great people, travel to places and learn new things! I believe that Volunteering Peel has made volunteering a whole lot more fun and exciting for students who want to give back to their communities. During my free time, I like to read, write short stories, play instruments, listen to music, watch anime, hang out with friends and family and go stargazing. If you ever see me roaming around, don't hesitate to come and introduce yourself; it would be a pleasure to meet you!"),

I am thrilled to be on the Volunteering Peel team for the second year as one of the Heads of Public Relations. Volunteering Peel not only connects students to volunteer opportunities, but also connects students to students. As cliché as it sounds, my favourite part about volunteering is definitely all the people I have met through it. It’s amazing what a simple conversation with the volunteer next to you can become.  In my free time I love to listen to Shawn Mendes and Hamilton, play with my dog, binge watch Netflix/Youtube videos, and read. If you ever see me at an event, don't hesitate to introduce yourself and start up a conversation. It would be a pleasure to meet you!"),

I'm super excited to start my second year with Volunteering Peel as one of the Heads of Events Requests.  To me, volunteering is not only about helping others or the community, but also myself. It means leaving and thinking that somebody in this world is happier or better off because of something you did. Other than volunteering, I love to procrastinate! I never have time to sleep but I somehow always make time to read, eat and watch TV (homework gets squished in between). So if you ever see me at an event and want to talk about Harry Potter, Once Upon A Time, Doritos or other random stuff, don't hesitate to introduce yourself!"),

It has been a pleasure to be a part of Volunteering Peel because I get the chance not only to work with an amazing team of individuals who are motivated and self-driven, but also to meet all of you passionate volunteers who are dedicated to helping the community!  Aside from volunteering, I love doing art in all forms of media; it could be anything from painting to drawing to sculpting. Now that you know a little about me, it is only fair to say that I’m open to learning more about you. So, if you ever see me around at events, don’t be afraid to start a conversation!"),

Volunteering not only gives me happiness but also allows me to spread my passion of volunteering with others around me. When volunteering, I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them. It astonishes me what great friends can be made at volunteering events. Aside from volunteering I enjoy swimming, playing the piano and playing badminton.

VP and volunteering have opened many doors for me, and I'm happy to continue opening doors for future generations of students. Some of my interests are food, anime, Marvel, Indian cuisine and culture, and Hearthstone (though I suck at it).

I’m a grade 10 student attending Stephen Lewis Secondary School and I love volunteering because it gives you satisfaction while you’re benefitting the community. The wise Meredith Grey once said, “Being grateful means recognizing what you have for what it is, appreciating small victories.” Just as Meredith said it, happiness comes from appreciating the little things in life and the tiny actions you make that create a difference in the world… such as volunteering! As you can probably tell, in my free time I like to watch Grey’s Anatomy and pretty much every other TV show on Netflix. I’m also a huge bubble tea enthusiast and play trumpet in my free time. If you ever see me at an event, feel free to holler at me and we can have a deep talk about the best bubble tea flavours or newest TV shows."),

My goal is to bring other high school students the same rewarding experiences that volunteering can provide to the community and to ourselves. Come and talk to me about books, cats, science facts, music, or just to strike a conversation. I’ll hope to see all of you soon at future events!"),

This is my first year on the Volunteering Peel team as a committee member and I’m loving it! Volunteering has become such a big part of my life in the past few months, as there is nothing more fulfilling than spending a day helping your community alongside your peers. Additionally volunteering, both in and outside my community has allowed to me meet so many new and interesting people that I would have never had the opportunity to meet otherwise. Outside of school work and studying I spend my time reading, cooking, gaming and watching excessive amounts of Game of Thrones. If you see me at an event don't be afraid to come and say hi.

While I haven’t been volunteering for too long, every one of my experiences has inevitably led me to become more happy and grateful for things in life. I’ve gotten the chance to try a ton of new things and make instant friends. Asides from volunteering and doing my homework, you can find me using my spare time learning Mandarin, reading, bullet journaling, hanging out with my family, or practicing the piano.

You can develop new skills, meet new people, and give back to the community, all while spending time with friends and family. Remember, there may not be “I” in team, but there’s definitely “U” in volunteer, so don’t be afraid to come out and join us!

I am very grateful that I have had the opportunity to be a part of such a wonderful atmosphere compiled of great individuals. This is my first year at Volunteering Peel as a committee member but I feel like I’ve been here for a while thanks to everyone's warm welcomes. Volunteering to me has a very significant value in my heart. I volunteer in hope that I create a sort of change in my community, a positive change. I get to see and meet wonderful new faces who provide me with the experience that allows me to grow as an individual. I am truly grateful for the impacts volunteering has had on my life. My goal is to make you feel what I experience when I deliver assistance partaking in a specific volunteering activity. In terms of what I do, I spend most of my time studying and working my butt off for the perfect grades. When I am not doing that, I enjoy playing football (soccer), spending time with my friends and family, as well as squeeze in a little time for some video games. Please do not hesitate to smile and say hello when you see me at our future events. Can’t wait to meet you!"),

In fact, according to Harvard Health, it has been proven (through the measure of hormones and brain activity) that volunteering actually makes you happier and counteracts the effects of stress, anger, and anxiety! I also have a passion for photography and mainly take pictures of exotic cars, as I’m a huge car enthusiast.
